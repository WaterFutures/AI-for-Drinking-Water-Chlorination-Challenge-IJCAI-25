# Example Submission

This folder contains a sample submission.
It consists of a [written report](report.pdf) (using the IJCAI template) and the [Python code](load_my_policy.py) (together with a [REQUIREMENTS.txt](REQUIREMENTS.txt) file) for loading the pre-trained policy/controller (do not forget to include the trained weights, parameters, etc.) -- in this example, we are loading a neural network (trained by the proximal-policy-optimization method using the [Stable-Baselines3](https://stable-baselines3.readthedocs.io/en/master/) package) for mapping observations to actions.

For the submission, please create and submit a single .zip containing all files.
